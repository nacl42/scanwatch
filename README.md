# scanwatch
simple utility to watch a directory and forward any new pdf file within to a printing frontend

## current status

*05.11.2021*: directory is being watched and if a new file is created, a
command can be executed. UNFORTUNATELY, the old printer frontend gtklp
is no longer properly maintained, at least it does not work on my
ArchLinux system. Therefore this is still not functional.
